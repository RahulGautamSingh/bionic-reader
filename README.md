# bionic-reader
Chrome Extension

Converts web-page text to bionic form. 

[WIP]
Breaks some functionality like input, links and (more to find) on sites. So I suggest to use it where the sole purpose it consuming written content.

Even at this state it is usable.

To use do the following:

1. Download the files locally in a folder (say Bionic Reader).
2. Open Chrome go to chrome://extensions/
3. Drag and drop the Bionic Reader folder in extensions tab.
4. You will be able to see this ectension in you extension menu, pin it and change permissions to "When you click extension"
5. Whenever you are reading a article, click on the pinned icon and your text will be converted.

Happpy Reading!!!
